<p>Hi, I am a graduate student pursuing Data Science at New York University with a string undergraduate  background in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India. </p>

<p>I love to play around with data and extract useful insights from it. Products backed with strong artificial intelligence mesmerise me and I dream to develop products that are capable of reciprocating the same wow factor.  I am also passionate about deep learning and am actively working towards increasing my knowledge in the field. </p>
